# PreReq -- Technical PRD

This PRD has been split into two focused documents:

1. **ML and AI Integration**  
   See: `techPRD-ml-ai-integration.md`

2. **Backend System and Actual System Design**  
   See: `techPRD-backend-systems-design.md`

---

## Split Notes

- Original intent and requirements are preserved.
- ML-focused modeling and inference content is moved into the ML/AI file.
- Backend architecture, APIs, frontend system surfaces, and delivery constraints are moved into the systems-design file.
- Keep this file as the entry point index.
