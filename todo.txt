Backend ML+AI Production Pre-Implementation TODO

1) Define product scope and success criteria
- Finalize MVP features for backend + ML/AI integration.
- Write measurable success metrics (latency, accuracy, completion rates, adoption).
- Confirm non-goals to prevent scope creep.

2) Confirm data contracts and source systems
- List each upstream system and exact payloads/events we will consume.
- Define required fields, optional fields, and validation rules.
- Document data freshness and expected sync frequency.

3) Gather UMich Canvas API details (required input from you)
- Confirm Canvas instance/base URL for UMich environment.
- Share auth approach available to us (developer key/OAuth2 token/PAT/service account).
- Provide sandbox vs production access details.
- List endpoints we are allowed to use (courses, users, enrollments, assignments, submissions, grades, files, discussions, calendar, etc.).
- Confirm API rate limits/throttling and retry guidance.
- Clarify pagination patterns and webhook/event support.
- Share field-level access constraints (FERPA/privacy restrictions).
- Confirm Terms of Use/compliance requirements for storing or processing Canvas data.

4) Security and compliance prerequisites
- Define PII handling policy and data minimization rules.
- Confirm encryption requirements (at rest + in transit).
- Set retention/deletion policy and audit logging expectations.
- Document secrets management approach (no secrets in repo, use env/secret manager).

5) Architecture and environment readiness
- Finalize target architecture diagram (services, queues, DBs, model serving path).
- Create dev/staging/prod environment matrix and promotion path.
- Choose observability stack (logs, metrics, traces, alerts) and SLO targets.
- Confirm rollback strategy and incident response process.

6) ML/AI readiness checklist
- Define model objective, offline metrics, and acceptance thresholds.
- Confirm feature availability and data labeling quality.
- Decide model lifecycle workflow (training cadence, evaluation, registry, deployment).
- Define guardrails: hallucination handling, confidence thresholds, safe fallbacks.
- Plan human-in-the-loop review for critical decisions.

7) API and backend engineering tasks before build
- Draft API contracts (OpenAPI/JSON schema) and versioning strategy.
- Define idempotency, retry behavior, and error taxonomy.
- Plan background job architecture and queue semantics.
- Create migration plan for schema changes and backfills.

8) Testing and launch readiness
- Prepare test plan: unit, integration, contract, load, and failure injection.
- Define staged rollout (internal alpha -> pilot -> GA).
- Create runbooks and on-call ownership.
- Define post-launch KPI dashboard and weekly review cadence.

9) Decisions needed from stakeholders
- Who owns Canvas integration credentials and approval process?
- Which user roles/data scopes are in-scope for phase 1?
- What is the target launch date and acceptable risk level?
- What budget/compute limits should govern model training/inference?

Immediate next step:
- Share the UMich Canvas API access details in section (3); that is the main blocker before implementation planning can be finalized.
